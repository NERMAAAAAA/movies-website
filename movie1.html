          In "The Dark Knight," Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime.
          With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey
          Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal
          organizations that plague the streets of Gotham. However, their
          partnership proves to be effective but short-lived as a criminal
          mastermind known only as the Joker emerges to unleash a reign of chaos
          upon the city. The story delves into themes of heroism, morality, and
          the fine line between justice and revenge.

          Directed by Christopher Nolan and featuring a stellar performance by
          Heath Ledger as the Joker, "The Dark Knight" is a gripping tale of
          action, drama, and psychological depth. It continues to be celebrated
          as one of the greatest superhero films of all time.
